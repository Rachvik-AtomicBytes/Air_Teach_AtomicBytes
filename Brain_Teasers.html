    <h1>Let's Play a Few Brain Teasers, for a Break!</h1>
    <p> 1. CHALLENGING BRAIN TEASERS IMPROVE YOUR MEMORY <br>
        Like the old adage says: your memory is the first to go. However, you can keep it in tip-top shape with brain games and puzzles. How exactly does it improve memory? Well, it reinforces the connection between your brain cells which results in a sharper short-term memory.<br>
        
        When you play brain games, you’re constantly having to remember shapes and patterns — this strengthens memory. Also, studies show that playing challenging brain teasers improve overall cognitive function and can even reduce brain damage in those with Alzheimer’s.<br>
        
        2. BRAIN GAMES WORK BOTH SIDES OF YOUR BRAIN <br>
        If you’re not aware, the brain has two sides: right and left. The left side of your brain is said to be responsible for analytical and logical thinking while the right side controls creativity.<br>
        
        When you do challenging brain teasers like escape room or puzzles, you’re working both sides of your brain. This results in improved logic skills and creativity. <br>
        
        3. IMPROVED PROBLEM SOLVING SKILLS<br>
        Problem-solving skills are essential in life. Brainbusters are a great way to hone these skills and improve them.<br>
        
        Brainbusters are constantly challenging you to come up with new solutions to a variety of problems which gives you the perfect opportunity to flex your critical thinking skills!<br>
        
        4. BRAIN TEASERS INCREASE YOUR MOOD<br>
        A less known benefit of brain teasers is that they improve your mood. Games like puzzles and escape room increase the production of dopamine — the chemical in the brain that regulates mood.
        After you successfully complete a challenging brain teaser, this releases that chemical and makes you feel happier! <br>
        
        5. THEY LOWER YOUR STRESS LEVELS <br>
        Completing puzzles has a therapeutic effect on our minds. Concentrating on one task allows our brain cells to relax — resulting in reduced stress. This is another reason why brain games are great for your mental health! <br>
        
        6. PUZZLES IMPROVE SPATIAL REASONING <br>
        Do you have a poor sense of direction and get lost easily? Incorporating puzzles into your daily life may help. <br>
        
        Challenging brain teasers help improve visual and spatial reasoning which helps improve your navigational and driving skills. <br>
        
        7. BRAIN GAMES IMPROVE YOUR IQ <br>
        Since brainbusters improve your logic, problem-solving, concentration and spatial reasoning, it’s obvious that it increases your IQ as well. <br>
        
        A study done by the University of Michigan found that doing challenging brain teasers for at least 25 minutes a day can improve your IQ by 4 points.<br>
        
        Give Your Brain the Workout It Craves. <br>
        
        Who knew something fun could be so beneficial? <br>
        
        Now that you know how challenging brain teasers can improve your mental health and cognitive function, it’s wise to incorporate solving puzzles into your daily life! <br> </p>
